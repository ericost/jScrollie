jScrollie is a lightweight jQuery plugin that allows you to skin your scroll bars. I wrote it because most of the js scroll bar solutions I had seen felt sluggish and non-native. jScrollie works by pushing the original scroll bar behind a div with overflow-x set to hidden, which lets you maintain your original scrolling mechanism. A "fake", HTML-based scroll bar is then generated and placed where the user expects the original scroll bar to appear.

jScrollie is based almost entirely on http://code.google.com/p/scrollbarpaper/
